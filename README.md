# Numerical Methods

This repository contains **theoretical notes (PDF/DOC)** and **C++ implementations**
of classical numerical methods taught in undergraduate engineering and
computer science courses.

The goal of this repository is to provide a **combined reference of theory + code**
for learning, lab work, and revision.
